character markov generator, with arbitrary memory
## Options

`lein run [memory] [input-files ...]`

Memory defaults to 1, the input file defaults to the included text of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. If multiple files are provided, the ngrams are summed from all the inputs.

A memory of 4 will typically recreate recognizable English language text.

You can get a decent result with:
`lein run 4 resources/little-red.txt resources/gettysburg.txt  resources/gettysburg.txt resources/gettysburg.txt resources/gettysburg.txt`
The multiple instances of a single file raise the relative strengths of ngrams from that file.
